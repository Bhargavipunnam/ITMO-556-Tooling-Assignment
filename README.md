## Step 5: Installing Packer
Packer is a tool for creating machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. This helps in automating the creation of consistent and repeatable infrastructure. I installed Packer using Chocolatey, and the process is documented in the screenshot below.

## Step 6: Verifying Versions of Installed Tools
After installing Git, Vagrant, and Packer, I verified their versions to ensure they were correctly installed. The commands used to check the versions and their outputs are shown in the screenshot below.

- **Git Version**: This confirms that Git version 2.46.0 is installed.
- **Vagrant Version**: This confirms that Vagrant version 2.4.1 is installed.
- **Packer Version**: This confirms that Packer version 1.11.0 is installed. Note that an update is available for Packer.
