# ITMO-556-Tooling-Assignment

# Tooling Assignment

## Introduction
This repository contains the tooling setup assignment for the ITMO-556 course. The following steps outline the installation and verification of essential tools using package managers on Windows.
## Outcome
By following this tutorial, I have successfully set up a comprehensive development environment using Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows. The tools installed include Git for version control, Vagrant for virtual machine management, Packer for infrastructure automation, and PowerShell Core for scripting. These installations provide a solid foundation for future tasks in cloud-native application development and automation, as required by the ITMO-556 course.


## Step 1: Installing Chocolatey
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that simplifies the installation and management of software. Below is a screenshot confirming the successful installation of Chocolatey.

## Step 5: Installing Packer
Packer is a tool for creating machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. This helps in automating the creation of consistent and repeatable infrastructure. I installed Packer using Chocolatey, and the process is documented in the screenshot below.

## Step 6: Verifying Versions of Installed Tools
After installing Git, Vagrant, and Packer, I verified their versions to ensure they were correctly installed. The commands used to check the versions and their outputs are shown in the screenshot below.

- **Git Version**: This confirms that Git version 2.46.0 is installed.
- **Vagrant Version**: This confirms that Vagrant version 2.4.1 is installed.
- **Packer Version**: This confirms that Packer version 1.11.0 is installed. Note that an update is available for Packer.

## Summary
This assignment involved installing and configuring several essential development tools using Chocolatey. Each tool—Git, Vagrant, Packer, and PowerShell Core—was installed successfully, and their versions were verified to ensure they are correctly set up. The environment is now fully prepared for further coursework, particularly tasks involving version control, virtual machine management, and infrastructure automation.

The installation process demonstrated the efficiency and convenience of using a package manager like Chocolatey, which simplified the installation and configuration of these tools. Any issues, such as the availability of newer versions of Packer, have been noted for future updates. This setup ensures that I am well-equipped to handle the challenges and requirements of the ITMO-556 course.



## Conclusion
Through this assignment, I have established a robust development environment using Chocolatey on a Windows system. The tools installed—Git, Vagrant, Packer, and PowerShell Core—are integral to cloud-native development and automation tasks. Each step of the installation process was meticulously documented, and the tools were verified to be functioning as expected.

This environment will support my learning and project work in the ITMO-556 course, enabling me to manage version control, create and manage virtual machine environments, and automate infrastructure provisioning. The process has underscored the benefits of using a package manager for automated and consistent tool installations, ensuring a reliable setup for future work.
